WHAT IT IS
A static HTML search page with jQuery UI autocomplete over a hardcoded list
of programming languages and a placeholder AJAX search submit.

WHO IT'S FOR
Primary user/persona: Not found in repo.

WHAT IT DOES
- Renders a single text input and a "Search" button.
- Shows autocomplete suggestions from a fixed language list (availableTags).
- Uses jQuery UI autocomplete bound to the #search-form input.
- Triggers a client-side AJAX POST on button click (URL is empty).
- Expects a JSON response with status.code handling (stub only).
- Loads jQuery and jQuery UI assets plus an external demo stylesheet.

HOW IT WORKS (ARCHITECTURE)
- UI: index.html with input and button.
- Client logic: inline JavaScript using jQuery and jQuery UI.
- Data: availableTags array in the page script (no external data source).
- Network: AJAX POST to "" with payload { text: itemids } (itemids not defined).
- Backend/service/storage: Not found in repo.

HOW TO RUN (MINIMAL STEPS)
1. Open index.html in a browser (or serve the repo root with any static server).
2. Ensure the JS/CSS asset paths in index.html resolve; the repo contains
   js/jquery-1.9.1.js, js/jquery-ui.js, and css/jquery-ui.css, but the HTML
   currently references ../demo/... paths.
3. Backend/API for the AJAX request: Not found in repo.
